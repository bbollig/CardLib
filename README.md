# CardLib
### Deck of Cards Program 

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/fcl5q4vv3y0v1hr6/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/bbollig/cardlib/branch/master)

A code library that mimics a deck of cards. I am using this project as a learning tool for the following things:

1. **.NET/C#/OOP** - Card Library is an ongoing project in a textbook I currently working through. As each chapter progresses, teaching new concepts, those concepts are implemented into the Card Library.
2. **TDD** - While the textbook does not teach TDD-- and this is not strictly speaking Test **_Driven_** Development seeing as how the textbook is doing the driving-- I am taking the opportunity to write tests for the library as it progresses using MSTest as an opportunity to work with a Test Framework.
3. **CI with AppVeyor** - I am also including an AppVeyor integration as a Continuous Integration tool to run automated builds on all my commits and branches. See the current status of the master brach above!
4. **Git** - Using git branches and opening Pull Requests on each chapter provides an interesting learning tool for me. As I complete a new feature or chapter, I can open a PR for it. I'll then leave it open for a few days to a week allowing me to move on to the next thing. I'll then come back to the PR and do a self-code review as a sort of refresher before merging it into the master branch.
